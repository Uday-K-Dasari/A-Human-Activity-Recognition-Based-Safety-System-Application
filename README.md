# Women-Safety-System-using-HAR-and-LSTM-Networks
Developed a womenâ€™s safety system using Human Activity Recognition (HAR) with RNNs and LSTMs. Trained on the UCI HAR dataset, it detects abnormal activities like falls or erratic movements and sends SOS alerts, sharing real-time location with emergency contacts. A proactive solution combining AI and real-time response for enhanced safety.
